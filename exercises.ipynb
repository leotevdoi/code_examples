    "### Task:\n",
    "Natasha wants to give her mum a gift - hand-made beaded necklace. She bought a needlework-kit, which contained beads of different size, shape and form. Each type of beads is marked by a distinct letter of latin alphabet. Kit includes an instruction, which is a sequence of latin letters.\n",
    "Natashas little brother took her beads and began to write down their color one by one. Doing so, he could scroll the necklace around several times, not necessarily ending one the same bead he started.\n",
    "The beads are lost as well as the original instruction. And Natasha decided to use the brother's notes to make another necklace. Unfortunately, brother's scribbles are only partly legible, but Natasha can try to make a necklace that will at least meet all the legible symbols.\n",
    "Find the least possible number of beads in the resulting necklace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input format:\n",
    "First line contains an integer \n",
    "$n$ $(1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)$ – number of symbols in brother's notes.\n",
    "Second line consists of sequence of beads in the notes. It consists of \n",
    "$n$ symbols – lowercase letters and symbol #, which means that letter on that position is unreadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output format:\n",
    "Print one positive integer – least possible number of beads in acceptable sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanations:\n",
    "In first example all letters were legible, shortest possible sequence can consist of 3 beads — abc.  \n",
    "In second example all letters were legible, shortest possible sequence can consist of 3 beads — abb.  \n",
    "In third example shortest sequence is possible if letter 'a' is third in sequence. Then the original sequence is ababa and shortest combination is 2 beads — ab.  \n",
    "In fourth example original sequence could be anything, for example ffffff. Then sequence could consist of only one letter — f.\n"
